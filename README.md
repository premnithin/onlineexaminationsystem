# Online-Exam-Final-Project
An online examination system is a web-based software application that enables educational institutions to conduct exams and assessments over the internet. This system provides a secure and efficient way for students to take tests remotely, while also providing instructors with tools to create and administer exams, grade them, and analyze results.

This abstract describes the main features and benefits of an online examination system, including flexibility, convenience, and scalability. The system allows students to take exams from anywhere, at any time, without the need for physical attendance. It also provides various question types, such as multiple-choice, fill-in-the-blank, and essay questions, as well as automatic grading and feedback.

Furthermore, the system provides instructors with tools to create and manage exams, monitor student progress, and analyze results. They can set timers, limits, and randomization to ensure fair and secure exams. The system also enables them to generate reports on student performance, analyze trends, and identify areas for improvement.
